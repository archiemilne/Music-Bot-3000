# Music-Bot-3000
This is a personal project of mine, attempting to create new music from midi files. Nothing spectacular just for fun.
## How to use
1. Clone the repo or save the '`midi_generator.py`' script.
2. Make dir/folder called '`midi_in`', or change the constant in the script.
3. Place midi files into the '`midi_in`' folder. The more inputted files the better the end result.
4. Create a dir/folder called '`midi_out`', or change the constant in the script to your designated output folder.
5. Run the script, and wait until a file pops out the end 🙂

If you find any problems, please let me know, and I may or may not get around to fixing it.
