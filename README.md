# Music-Bot-3000
This is a personal project of mine, attempting to create new music from midi files. Nothing spectacular just for fun.
## How to use
1. Clone the repo to save the `midi_generator.py` script. (if you just copy the script be sure to create folders*)
2. Place midi files into the `midi_in` folder. The more inputted files the better the end result, but the longer it takes.
3. Run and enjoy! ðŸ™‚

### *Folders to create (if you don't clone the repo):
1. `midi_in`
2. `midi_out`
3. `weights`

If you find any problems, please let me know, and I may or may not get around to fixing it.
