# Music-Bot-3000
This is a personal project of mine, attempting to create new music from midi files. Nothing spectacular just for fun.
## How to use
1.  Clone the repo or save the `midi_generator.py` script.
2.  Make dir/folder called `midi_in`, or change the constant in the script.
3.  Place midi files into the `midi_in` folder. The more inputted files the better the end result.
4.  Create a dir/folder called `midi_out`, or change the constant in the script to your designated output folder.
5.  Run the script, and wait until a file pops out the end ðŸ™‚

If you find any problems, please let me know, and I may or may not get around to fixing it.
