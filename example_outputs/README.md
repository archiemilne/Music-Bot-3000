## Example Outputs
Here is some info about the files in this folder.

### 23-03-27_BS
The first two files uploaded here are my first two outputs on the v1.3 code. They did not train for long, and had a small quantity of training data, but they were my first outputs that weren't just one note repeated.

Their training data was 7 Bruce Springsteen songs (Badlands, Born to Run, Hungry Heart, I'm on Fire, Jungleland, Tenth Avenue Freeze Out, and The River), although you wouldn't be able to tell based on the output.

### 23-03-29_FSB
These two files came from a much longer length of training using the v1.3 code. 30 and 50 epochs with a training data of Beatles and various 50s and 60s Rock music.

When listeing you can hear there is a small amount of structure forming. It would be nice to hear a longer quantity of music produced, possibly a good goal for v1.4 of the code.
