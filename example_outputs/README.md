## Example Outputs
Here is some info about the files in this folder.

### 23-03-27_BS
The first two files uploaded here are my first two outputs on the v1.3 code. They did not train for long, and had a small quantity of training data, but they were my first outputs that weren't just one note repeated.

Their training data was 7 Bruce Springsteen songs (Badlands, Born to Run, Hungry Heart, I'm on Fire, Jungleland, Tenth Avenue Freeze Out, and The River), although you wouldn't be able to tell based on the output.
